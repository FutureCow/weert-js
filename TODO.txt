CONFIGURATION

Need to have entry points in package.json for development vs production builds.

Instead of just importing D3, import the minimal set of D3 components, using NPM.


SERVER

CQ timer slowly advances forward in time. It needs to calculate the exact time to the
next publishing event. Plus, it fails if the server is suspended (as on a laptop).

Need to publish new stats as they become available.

Need to refactor CQ specs so they use the configuration file config/obs_type.js

Need to record gust directions.



CLIENT

Deal with unit systems.

Highlight changed values in the "since midnight" stats area.

Switch to React.PureComponent

DATABASE

Need utility to load sqlite archived records into InfluxDB.


DOCUMENTATION

RESTful API examples don't specify a unit_system
