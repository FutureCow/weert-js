CONFIGURATION



SERVER

* Results from query on wxrecords for 'today' starts at 0010, not 0005.
  (Need to shift the time in ALL select statements! This includes aggregations.)

* CQs need to record wind gusts.

CQ timer slowly advances forward in time. It needs to calculate the exact time to the
next publishing event. Plus, it fails if the server is suspended (as on a laptop).

Need to record gust directions.



CLIENT

* Live update of "stats" section.

* Multiple plot lines for each plot.

* Check that Metric units work in client.

Add reducers and UI code to deal with failed requests FETCH_TIMESPAN_FAILURE and FETCH_STATS_FAILURE.

WindCompass assumes US units.

Introduce a system of style classes.

Need a timer that at the end of a time spans ('day', 'wee', etc.) emits an event, advancing the chart.

Browser window hangs if it is not the focus for a long period of time.

Look into using react-smooth or react-transition-group instead of d3 to do WindCompass
transition.

Highlight changed values in the "since midnight" stats area.

Take advantage of isFetching in WindCompass




DATABASE

Need utility to load sqlite archived records into InfluxDB.
