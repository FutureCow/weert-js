CONFIGURATION

Update README install instructions to reflect separate client and server installs.


SERVER

CQ timer slowly advances forward in time. It needs to calculate the exact time to the
next publishing event. Plus, it fails if the server is suspended (as on a laptop).

Need to publish new stats as they become available.

Need to refactor CQ specs so they use the configuration file config/obs_type.js

Need to record gust directions.



CLIENT

Add "stats" section.

Plots:
 o Need to clip data as necessary for "recent" plots

Introduce a system of style classes.

Use tabs to switch between time scale.

Live update of "stats" section.

Browser window hangs if it is not the focus for a long period of time.

Look into using react-smooth or react-transition-group instead of d3 to do WindCompass
transition.

Deal with unit systems.

Highlight changed values in the "since midnight" stats area.

Take advantage of isFetching in WindCompass

The <caption> in PacketTable does not seem to work consistently. Just use a heading instead.

Use d3-time-format to format times instead of moment. Should be much smaller.


DATABASE

Need utility to load sqlite archived records into InfluxDB.


DOCUMENTATION

RESTful API examples don't specify a unit_system
