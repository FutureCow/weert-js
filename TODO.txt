CONFIGURATION

Update README install instructions to reflect separate client and server installs.


SERVER

CQ timer slowly advances forward in time. It needs to calculate the exact time to the
next publishing event. Plus, it fails if the server is suspended (as on a laptop).

Need to publish new stats as they become available.

Need to refactor CQ specs so they use the configuration file config/obs_type.js

Need to record gust directions.



CLIENT

Why are no packets being downloaded on start?

Take advantage of react-bootstrap. Include a grid layout.

Add "stats" section.

Improve tool-tips when hovering over plots.

Deal with unit systems.

Highlight changed values in the "since midnight" stats area.

Take advantage of isFetching in WindCompass

Better styling

Use d3-time-format to format times instead of moment. Should be much smaller.


DATABASE

Need utility to load sqlite archived records into InfluxDB.


DOCUMENTATION

RESTful API examples don't specify a unit_system
