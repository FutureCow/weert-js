CONFIGURATION

* Update README install instructions to reflect separate client and server installs.


SERVER

* Allow queries that involve aggregation.

* Results from query on wxrecords for 'today' starts at 0010, not 0005.

CQ timer slowly advances forward in time. It needs to calculate the exact time to the
next publishing event. Plus, it fails if the server is suspended (as on a laptop).

Need to refactor CQ specs so they use the configuration file config/obs_type.js

Need to record gust directions.



CLIENT

* Live update of "stats" section.

* Add aggregregations for longer time spans.

* Multiple plot lines for each plot.

Introduce a system of style classes.

Browser window hangs if it is not the focus for a long period of time.

Look into using react-smooth or react-transition-group instead of d3 to do WindCompass
transition.

Deal with unit systems.

Highlight changed values in the "since midnight" stats area.

Take advantage of isFetching in WindCompass




DATABASE

Need utility to load sqlite archived records into InfluxDB.
